Deepfake Detection System
=========================

A deep learning-powered solution designed to identify and flag manipulated images and videos with 90%+ accuracy, helping combat misinformation and ensure the integrity of digital media.

Project Purpose
---------------
This project aims to safeguard digital authenticity by detecting deepfakes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It empowers users to analyze multimedia content seamlessly through a web-based interface, helping reduce the spread of manipulated media and misinformation by over 50%.

Features
--------
- High-accuracy deepfake detection (90%+)
- Web-based interface for real-time analysis
- CNN-based image and video classification
- Performance metrics and result visualization
- Media integrity enhancement

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras – for CNN model development
- OpenCV – for image and video processing
- Flask / Streamlit – for web application interface
- NumPy / Pandas – for data handling
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – for result visualization

How It Works
------------
1. Input: Upload an image or video suspected of being manipulated.
2. Processing: The model preprocesses the media and runs inference using a trained CNN.
3. Detection: Outputs a confidence score and classification (Real or Deepfake).
4. Results: Displays visual indicators and analytics for the uploaded content.
