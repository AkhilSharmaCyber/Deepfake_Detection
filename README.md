Deepfake Detection System
=========================

A deep learning-powered solution designed to identify and flag manipulated images and videos with 90%+ accuracy, helping combat misinformation and ensure the integrity of digital media.

Project Purpose
---------------
This project aims to safeguard digital authenticity by detecting deepfakes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It empowers users to analyze multimedia content seamlessly through a web-based interface, helping reduce the spread of manipulated media and misinformation by over 50%.

Features
--------
- 🔍 High-accuracy deepfake detection (90%+)
- 🌐 Web-based interface for real-time analysis
- 🧠 CNN-based image and video classification
- 📈 Performance metrics and result visualization
- ✅ Media integrity enhancement and misinformation mitigation

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python – Core language for development
- TensorFlow / Keras – For building and training the CNN model
- OpenCV – For video frame extraction and image preprocessing
- Flask / Streamlit – Web interface to interact with the model
- NumPy / Pandas – Efficient data handling and manipulation
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization of prediction metrics

How It Works
------------
1. 📤 **Upload Media**: Users upload an image or video suspected to be manipulated.
2. 🧠 **Preprocessing**: The input is processed using OpenCV to normalize the data and extract video frames.
3. 🧮 **Prediction**: The trained CNN model analyzes the input and predicts whether it's real or deepfake with a confidence score.
4. 📊 **Visualization**: Results are visualized using graphs and performance metrics.
5. 🌐 **Interface**: A simple yet effective Flask/Streamlit frontend is provided for user interaction.
